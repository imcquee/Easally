# Installation
**IMPORTANT:** This program alters your local user registry values. It is not a total system change and can't affect other users, which is why it does not require administrator privileges. While safe in that regard, there is a high chance your antivirus will flag this as a trojan attack. The program is replacing the default boot program with the program you provide it. This is why it is seen as suspicious. Please go over the source code if you feel any hesitancy. Regardless, use at your own risk.
**IMPORTANT:** If your selected game launcher is already set to open upon starting windows, please disable that functionality. If not, the launcher will restart after it is initially closed.

 1. Run install.vbs
 2. Enter the path to the game launcher that you want to run in handheld mode

The installer also creates a shortcut on the desktop that allows you to quickly go back to handheld mode

To uninstall simple run uninstall.vbs

## Usage
After running the install script, your current account will now boot directly into your game launcher. Upon FULLY closing the game launcher, the desktop will reload in the background. To enter handheld mode again, click on the "Return to Game Mode" shortcut on the desktop
