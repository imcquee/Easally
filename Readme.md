# Installation

**IMPORTANT:** This program alters your local user registry values. It is not a total system change and can't affect other users, which is why it does not require administrator privileges. While safe in that regard, there is a chance your antivirus will flag this as a trojan attack. The program is replacing the default boot program with the program you provide it. I use this program on my own handheld computer and the antivirus has not flagged it so far. Please go over the source code if you feel any hesitancy, and use at your own risk.

**IMPORTANT:** If your selected game launcher is already set to open upon starting windows, please disable that functionality. If not, the launcher will restart after it is initially closed.

1. IMPORTANT: Extract all files before running. DO NOT run the script while previewing the zipped folder

2. Run install.vbs

3. Enter the path to the game launcher that you want to run in handheld mode. The easiest way to do this is by finding the exe for your launcher and copying its path from the file explorer. You can paste this value in BUT REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE QUOTES.

4. Open the shortcut on the desktop labeled: "Return to Game Mode"

5. Optional: Uncheck 'Always ask before opening this file' to be able to go to handheld mode without clicking yes every time

To uninstall simply run uninstall.vbs

## Usage

After running the install script, your current account will now boot directly into your game launcher. Upon FULLY closing the game launcher (e,g. in Steam BPM hit the menu button (xbox/sony) > Power > Exit Steam) the desktop will reload in the background. To enter handheld mode again, click on the "Return to Game Mode" shortcut on the desktop
